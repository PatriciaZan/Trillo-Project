# [Trillo Course Project 2](https://patriciazan.github.io/Trillo-Project/ )

This is the second Project from the course [Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/) taught by Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy.
Here I learned the fundamentals of Flexbox and continue practicing:
 - animations;
 - Media queries;
 - Variables.
